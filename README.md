<h3 align="center">As a passionate frontend developer, I am always striving to keep up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in the field. With experience completing both minor and major projects, working both on teams and solo, I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and SQL. I am committed to delivering the best possible user experience, and I enjoy working with teams to create intuitive and engaging websites that meet the needs of clients and end-users alike. I am comfortable taking on new challenges, and I am always seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and grow as a developer.</h3>
